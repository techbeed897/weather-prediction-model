This project involves building a machine learning model to predict weather conditions such as drizzle, rain, sun, snow, and fog based on features like precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and wind speed. The model is built using scikit-learn, a popular Python library for machine learning.

The project demonstrates how to use a Decision Tree Classifier to classify weather conditions based on historical weather data.
